Course-end Project 1

DESCRIPTION

For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

Domain: Finance

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.

Steps to be done: 

⦁    Load the dataset that is given to you
⦁    Check for null values in the dataset
⦁    Print percentage of default to payer of the dataset for the TARGET column
⦁    Balance the dataset if the data is imbalanced
⦁    Plot the balanced data or imbalanced data
⦁    Encode the columns that is required for the model
⦁    Calculate Sensitivity as a metrice
⦁    Calculate area under receiver operating characteristics curve
